There are two different distribution procedures for the CADP software:

- Industrial users can obtain a commercial license of CADP.
- Academic users (i.e., employees of universities and public research centers) can obtain a personal,
  free-of-charge license of CADP.
  The terms and conditions of this academic-only license are available in French and in English.
